About this project.
===========
This research is meant to be a social behavior study focusing on the Coronavirus Tweets Text
Mining and Sentiment Analysis and will be flexible to be transferred to other social media text datasets,
representing and communicating the information with the public. We implemented several data visualization(**word frequency analysis**) and machine learning(**topic modeling LDA**)/deep learning algorithms(**Fine-tuned Bert**) for this analysis. 

As a result, a website with these algorithms is deployed [here](https://bis634.herokuapp.com/)(Bert is temporarily not applicable here due to the package size limitation). To deploy a complete Covid tweets NLP API, you can check out the scource code [here]().
